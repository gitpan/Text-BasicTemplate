0.9.6.1: Fixed stupid idiotic bug caused by overzealous optimization (some
things were not meant to be done with references -- setting cache scalars,
f'rinstance).  Renamed from ParsePrint to BasicTemplate for submission to
CPAN.  Fixed oversight wherein files inserted via simple_ssi #includes were
having keys stripped, but not parsed first.

First fully public release.  Hooray...

0.9.6: Rewrote argument handling in constructor the same way;
deprecated old style arg passage.

0.9.5: Rewrote argument handling in parse_push to handle arbitrary
combinations of different arg types.

0.9.4.1: Fixed nasty bug that set the lvalue in comparison to
the name of the entitity lvalue, not the value thereof.

0.9.4: Lots of optimizations.  Inlined eval_conditional(),
introduced caching of condititionals (parse-once, print repeatedly),
other such changes.  Approximately doubled output speed to about
3100 conditionals/sec on my i686-200 Linux box.

0.9.3: First stable, releaseable version.  Much documentation.
