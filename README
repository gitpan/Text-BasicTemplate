Text::BasicTemplate v0.9.6.1
----------------------------

This is a template parsing module for perl5 and higher.  Originally
written for use with HTML templates, it has proved quite useful for
many kinds of printable-character file parsing.

Essentially a highly flexible, efficient search-and-replace mechanism,
it is typically used to parse templates on disk using specified key/value
pairs, conditional evaluation, etc.  Templates and the locations in
the templates of substitution keys are cached, so each template will
be parsed at most once.

Text::BasicTemplate does not eval anything from the templates, and passes
taint checking accordingly.  It uses references internally wherever
possible for efficiency, and provides type-flexible arguments to
the important functions (passage of substitutions by scalar, hash, hashref,
etc).

Copious documentation and examples provided within.
